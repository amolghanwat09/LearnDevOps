#Open browser and insert server IP in address bar, you will get nginx page

####### Lets do one practical for nginx as a loadbalancer #########
#You already have nginx server. We need application server to test.

#spin 2 amazon linux server with tomcat-userdata.sh, which help you to install tomcat and start tomcat server

#open browser and insert in address bar http://<ip>:8080 you should able to see tomcat page

#download webapp.war file from "form" branch of https://github.com/tciaindiadevops/TestWebApp.git  and copy it at /local/apps/tomcat/webapps/

#now again open browser and check below url of each server.
http://<ip>:8080/webapp
#You should able to open one form where it ask first name and last name and submit button.

#Now your application server is ready.

#Login on nginx server.

#add below configuration in http block of /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

upstream tomcat {
    # Use IP Hash for session persistence
    ip_hash;

    # List of Tomcat application servers
    server <application-server-IP-1>:8080;
    server <application-server-IP-2>:8080;
}

#add below configuration in /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default in server block

        location /webapp {
                proxy_pass http://tomcat;
        }

#test nginx configuration
nginx -t

#reload nginx
nginx -s reload

#open broser with URL http://<nginx-ip>/webapp it should show you our form application.

#To test nginx loadbalancer, monitor tomcat log on both server and check where request is going 
#and open 7-8 tab in browse and open application there...you will see some request going to first application 
#server and some requst going to second appliation server.

#Now stop one of the tomcat server and again try to refresh all those tab, for some time app will be down,
#but after 2-3 refresh, app will come up in some case.

#For more advance configuration you can download below files
