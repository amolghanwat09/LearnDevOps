1. Create Jenkins Master server
    Spin ec2 instance with jenkins-userdaa.sh given in main directory (LearnJENKINS).

2. Create Jenkins Slave server
    Spin ec2 instance

        useradd jenkins
        passwd jenkins
        sudo su - jenkins
        ssh-keygen -t rsa -N "" -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
        cd .ssh
        cat id_rsa.pub > authorized_keys
        chmod 700 authorized_keys

3. Setting for slave server in Master server on terminal
    execute below commands in Master server
        mkdir -p ~/.ssh
        cd ~/.ssh
        ssh-keyscan -H <<SLAVE_PRIVATE_IP_>> >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
        chmod 700 known_hosts

4. Setting for slave server in Master server on Jenkins console
    go to "Manage Nodes and Clouds"
    Click on "New Node" --> give node name "SLAVE1" --> select "Permanent Agent" --> OK
        "Description" = "Slave node"
        "Remote root directory" = "/local/apps/jenkins"
        "Labels" = "SLAVE1"
        "Launch method" = "Launch agent via SSH"
        "HOST" = <<SLAVE_PRIVATE_IP>>
        Click on "Add" --> "Jenkins"
            "Kind" = "SSH Username and private key"
            "ID" = "SLAVE1"
            "Description" = "key for slave1 server"
            "Username" = "Jenkins"
            "Private Key" --> Enter directly --> Add
                Copy containt of /home/jenkins/.ssh/id_rsa and paste here.
            Click on "Add"
