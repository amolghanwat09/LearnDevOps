Everything in one file dangerous. 

With variables you can....
1) hide data 
    You definetly don't want to expose AWS credential and other details which is important.
2) achieve flexibility 
    we can use variables in terraform files so that terraform script can be more generic in nature.
    i.e. You can spin ec2 instance in different region or az by just passing it as a parameter.

How variables work in terraform?
Lets take example of AWS credential. We are going to create seperate file for AWS credentail.
privder.tf  ----> In this file we use vaiable by using ${var.VARIABLENAME} or var.VARIABLENAME
----------
provider "aws" {
  access_key = var.AWS_ACCESS_KEY
  secret_key = var.AWS_SECRET_KEY
  region     = var.AWS_REGION
  az         = var.AWS_AZ
}

vars.tf ----> In this file we are defining variables, but not putting any values for them, but we can.
-------
variable "AWS_ACCESS_KEY" {}
variable "AWS_SECRET_KEY" {}
variable "AWS_REGION" { default = "us-east-2" }
variable "AWS_AZ" { default = "us-east-2a" }

terraform.tfvars    ----> In this file we are providing value to the variables. This file we will put in gitignore, so that this file will not get uploaded on git.
----------------
AWS_ACCESS_KEY = ""
AWS_SECRET_KEY = ""
AWS_REGION = ""
AWS_AZ = ""

variable mapping
-----------------
Sometimes variable value can be depend upon value of other variables. In this scenario we can use variable mapping.
In variable mapping, variable value changes as per variable of value of it's dependend variable.
i.e.
resource "aws_instance" "test" {
  ami           = var.AMIS[var.AWS_REGION]
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
In above example ami id of instance is depend upon it's region name.

variable default value
-----------------------
Sometimes we need to assign default value to variable, user forget to define value to the variable, but that variable is required to create resource.
i.e. While creating ec2, region is required parameter, so we can define default value, if that variable not assigned any value.
variable "AWS_REGION" { default = "us-east-2" }

Note : 
Define variable by using ---> variable "VARIABLENAME" { "VARIABLEVALUE" } 
Use variable by using ---> ${var.VARIABLENAME}
assign value in secret tfvars file by using ---> VARIABLENAME = "VARIABLEVALUE"

terraform.tfvars file also known as variable defination file. It can not be named something different.
